*Start building a Java Enterprise application with ZERO configuration.*

Supports :

	Backbone.js
	JQuery Template 
	JQuery Pub-Sub

This list is incomplete as the development is in progress.	

The goal of this project is to have a nice technology stack integrated in the system so that development on any Java Enterprise Application can be started from day one. That means the development team will not have to put any effort in - for example installing hibernate or spring or CXF etc.
